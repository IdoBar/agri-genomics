  abstract = {The orange-spotted grouper (OG), Epinephelus coioides, is an ecologically and economically important species with strong market demand. However, larval rearing for this species is especially difficult, with mass mortality occurring at multiple stages including the period coinciding with metamorphic development. The aim of the present study was to characterise the molecular ontogenesis of genes that influence appetite, feeding, and digestion in OG larvae head and body tissue at 12, 18, and 50\,days post hatch (dph), which coincides with the beginning and end of metamorphic development. The sequences of many transcripts involved in the regulation of appetite, feeding and digestive processes were detected from 12\,dph in OG larvae, including those that were differentially expressed in body tissue in fish at different stages of development such as cholecystokinin, peptide Y, and meprin A. Of the transcripts encoding digestive enzymes, only the expression level of bile salt-activated lipase decreased as development progressed. In contrast, a dramatic increase in expression for other body-expressed transcripts encoding digestive enzymes and a proton pump subunit was observed at 50\,dph, which is indicative of an increase in digestive capacity. In addition, we have provided evidence suggesting that various trypsinogen isoforms are present, and have differing expression patterns throughout larval development in whole body tissue. We also report on the presence of a prey-specific transcript encoding α-amylase that was present in the body-transcriptome. Taken together, these results give insight into the processes underpinning attainment of digestive capacity, and form the basis of a new transcriptomic database that will aid further study into the digestive development and dietary requirements of orange-spotted grouper larvae.},

  abstract = {Colors and their patterns are fascinating phenotypes with great importance for fitness under natural conditions. For this reason and because pigmentation is associated with diseases, much research was devoted to study the genetics of pigmentation in animals. Considerable contribution to our understanding of color phenotypes was made by studies in domesticated animals that exhibit dazzling variation in color traits. Koi strains, the ornamental variants of the common carp, are a striking example for color variability that was selected by man during a very short period on an evolutionary timescale. Among several pigmentation genes, genetic variation in Melanocrtin receptor 1 was repeatedly associated with dark pigmentation phenotypes in numerous animals. In this study, we cloned Melanocrtin receptor 1 from the common carp. We found that alleles of the gene were not associated with the development of black color in Koi. However, the mRNA expression levels of the gene were higher during dark pigmentation development in larvae and in dark pigmented tissues of adult fish, suggesting that variation in the regulation of the gene is associated with black color in Koi. These regulatory differences are reflected in both the timing of the dark-pigmentation development and the different mode of inheritance of the two black patterns associated with them. Identifying the genetic basis of color and color patterns in Koi will promote the production of this valuable ornamental fish. Furthermore, given the rich variety of colors and patterns, Koi serves as a good model to unravel pigmentation genes and their phenotypic effects and by that to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of colors also in natural populations.},

Tuna tubes are an array of vertical tubes that hold the fish, while fresh seawater is pumped up the tubes and through the fish mouth and gills, providing oxygen and removing wastes. In this study, 19 fish were captured using rod and line and 42~\% of the captured fish were transported alive in the custom-designed tuna tubes to an on-shore holding tank: five mackerel tuna (\emph{{{Euthynnus affinis}}}) and three leaping bonito (\emph{{{Cybiosarda elegans}}}). Out of these, just three (15.8~\% of total fish) acclimatized to the tank’s condition. Based on these results, we discuss an improved design of the tuna tubes that has the potential to increase survival rates and enable a simple and low cost method of transporting of live pelagic fish.},

  abstract = {Controlling and managing the breeding of bluefin tuna (Thunnus spp.) in captivity is an imperative step towards obtaining a sustainable supply of these fish in aquaculture production systems. Germ cell transplantation (GCT) is an innovative technology for the production of inter-species surrogates, by transplanting undifferentiated germ cells derived from a donor species into larvae of a host species. The transplanted surrogates will then grow and mature to produce donor-derived seed, thus providing a simpler alternative to maintaining large-bodied broodstock such as the bluefin tuna. Implementation of GCT for new species requires the development of molecular tools to follow the fate of the transplanted germ cells. These tools are based on key reproductive and germ cell-specific genes. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides a rapid, cost-effective method for high throughput gene identification in non-model species. This study utilized RNA-Seq to identify key genes expressed in the gonads of Southern bluefin tuna (\emph{{{Thunnus maccoyii}}}, SBT) and their specific expression patterns in male and female gonad cells.},

Necrotrophic fungal disease botrytis grey mould, caused by Botrytis cinerea and Botrytis fabae, significantly reduce temperate legume yield and grain quality during favourable environmental condition in Australia and worldwide. Several immunogenic and molecular probe-type protocols have been developed for their diagnosis, but these have varying levels of speciesspecificity, sensitivity, and consequent usefulness within the paddock. To substantially improve speed, accuracy, and sensitivity, advanced nanoparticle-based biosensor approaches have been developed. For this, two sets of primers were designed for both Botrytis cinerea and Botrytis fabae which have shown the species specificity with initial sensitivity of two genomic copies/µl in pure fungal backgrounds using multiplexed quantitative PCR. During further validation, quantitative PCR detected 100 spores on artificially infected legume leaves. Simultaneously an electro-catalytic assay was developed for both target fungal DNA using functionalised magnetic nanoparticles. This was extremely sensitive, able to detect a single spore within a raw total plant nucleic acid extract background. We believe that the translation of this technology to the field will enable quantitative assessment of pathogen load for future accurate decision support of informed botrytis grey mould management.},

  abstract = {Honeybees (Apis mellifera) depend entirely on floral resources (pollen and nectar) in their surrounding landscape to satisfy their dietary needs. Honeybee diets in temperate areas have been well studied, and there is increasing evidence that floral diversity is critical for honeybee health. Tropical forests often contain high floral diversity but honeybee diets have been rarely studied in the tropics. We aim to compare the botanical sources in bee bread between landscapes with and without surrounding forest cover in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. We collected bee bread from 24 hives across 8 sites over two years and examined floral sources, diversity measures and major plant groups using DNA metabarcoding. We identified a total of 89 taxa across 34 orders, 41 families, 84 genera and 61 species of botanical sources in bee bread. Bee bread from hives in sites with surrounding forest contained significantly greater species diversity (H’ Forest~=~1.4, H’ No forest~=~1.1) and species evenness (J Forest~=~0.68, J No forest~=~0.6). Trees were the most abundant source of bee bread, regardless of landscape, and constituted 52\% of total abundance. Herbaceous plants, mostly introduced species, were the second most abundant floral sources at~∼~26\% of total bee bread abundance, particularly in forest landscapes. We found the most abundant sources such as introduced tree species Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) and native tree species Syzigium unipunctatum (Myrtaceae) were foraged on in both landscapes; other common species included introduced species Hylodesmum nudifloram (Facbaceae) and Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae), and native food crop Entada phaseoloides (Fabaceae). Interestingly, many wind pollinated species were found in both landscapes including Araucaria (Araucariaceae), Pinus (Pinaceae), Nothofagaceae species and Poaceae species. Our work suggests that bees are seeking out floral tree resources even in landscapes where trees are scarce. Thus beekeeping in tropical environments would benefit from preserving remaining forest cover and incorporating more trees to existing, open landscapes to optimize the diversity in honeybee diets.},

  abstract = {Australian lentil production is affected by several major biotic constraints including Ascochyta blight (AB), caused by Ascochyta lentis, a devastating fungal disease. Cultivation of AB resistant cultivars, alongside agronomic management including fungicide application, is the current most economically viable control strategy. However, the breakdown of AB resistance in cultivars, such as Northfield and Nipper, suggests the need for introgression of new and diverse resistance genes. Successful introgression entails an understanding of the genetic basis of resistance. In this context, a biparental mapping population derived from a cross between a recently identified AB resistant accession ILWL 180 (Lens orientalis) and a susceptible cultivar ILL 6002 was produced. A genetic linkage map was constructed from single-nucleotide polymorphism markers generated using a genotyping-by-sequencing transcript approach. Genetic dissection of the mapping population revealed a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) region nested with three QTLs on linkage group 5 and explained 9.5–11.5 percent (\%) of phenotypic variance for AB resistance. Another QTL was identified on LG2 with phenotypic variance of 9.6\%. The identified QTL regions harbored putative candidate genes potentially associated with defense responses to A. lentis infection. The QTL analysis and the candidate gene information are expected to contribute to the development of diagnostic markers and enable marker-assisted resistance selection in lentil breeding programmes.},

  abstract = {Plant pathogens are a major reason for reduced crop productivity and may lead to shortage of food for both human and animal consumption. Although chemical control remains the main method to reduce foliar fungal disease incidence, frequent use can lead to loss of susceptibility in the fungal population. Also, over-spraying can cause environmental contamination and poses a heavy financial burden on growers. To prevent or control disease epidemics, it is important for growers to be able to detect the causal pathogen accurately, sensitively, and rapidly in order to choose and enact best practice disease management strategies. Several culture-dependent, biochemical, and molecular methods have been developed for plant pathogen detection. However, these suffer from lack of accuracy, specificity, reliability, and rapidity, and they are generally not suitable for in-situ analysis. Accordingly, there is strong interest in developing biosensing systems for early and accurate pathogen detection. There is also great scope to translate innovative nanoparticle-based biosensor approaches developed initially for human disease diagnostics for early detection of plant disease-causing pathogens. In this review, we compare conventional methods used in plant disease diagnostics with new biosensor technologies that may be applied for plant pathogen detection and management. In addition, we discuss challenges facing biosensors and new capability the technology provides to informing disease management strategies.},

  abstract = {Lentil among legumes has a significant place in crop production and rotation, and the nutritional security of growing human population. Current lentil cultivars have a narrow genetic base and are challenged with many biotic and abiotic stresses. The pressures from changing climate necessitate more efforts to find durable resistance sources for biotic and abiotic stresses. Distant landraces and wild lentil species which are less explored are known to possess such genes to develop resilient cultivars, one of the best adaptation strategies for climate change. The research efforts are currently focusing on enhancing lentil grain yield and resilience to climate change through introgression of desired genes from other gene pools. The current lentil-breeding efforts have concentrated upon conventional plant breeding techniques for the inclusion of the cultivated lentil gene pool only. Unlike other crops, genomics-assisted breeding remains one of the areas to be further explored to speed-up the climate-smart high-yielding cultivars development process, which is reliant on the extensive genomic resources. Several lentil linkage maps have been developed and quantitative trait loci for tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses have been identified. However, advances in molecular markers, next-generation sequencing, genomewide sequencing, and bioinformatics will further help to precisely identify genes of interest that can be best utilized to breed climate-resilient cultivars for higher production and quality through genetic engineering and plant breeding.},

Therefore, to improve these cultivars, useful untapped genes of interest need to be incorporated from wild and distant cultivated backgrounds.

  abstract = {The Southern bluefin tuna (SBT), \emph{{{Thunnus macoyii}}}, is one of Australia's most valuable aquaculture species, with total production valued at \$153 million in 2012/2013. The aquaculture of SBT is currently based solely on capture of wild fish and as such, it is limited by fishing regulations, annual quota and seasonal variation in fish availability. In order to provide sustainable, unlimited supply of SBT, novel and innovative methods are needed to successfully breed it in captivity, despite size and late maturation age limitations. Germ cell transplantation (GCT) is an innovative technology for the production of inter-species surrogates, capable of revolutionizing the aquaculture industry by facilitating easy handling, shorter generation time and a more economical management of large-bodied broodstock, such as the SBT. This study aimed at developing the specific methods, molecular tools and knowledge to establish GCT surrogates for the SBT. Yellowtail kingfish (YTK), \emph{{{Seriola lalandi}}}, was assessed as a potential surrogate host for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to produce SBT donor-derived gametes upon sexual maturity. In order to achieve this objective, germ cell populations were described in testis of donor SBT males using basic histology and the germ cell molecular markers vasa and dead-end genes. The peripheral area of SBT testis was found to contain the highest proportions of dead-end-expressing transplantable type A spermatogonia (ASG). Percoll-enriched SBT testicular germ cells preparations were then transplanted into the coelomic cavity of 7-9 days post hatch YTK larvae. Fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis have detected presence of SBT cells in the gonads of the transplanted YTK fingerlings at 18, 28, 39 and 75 days post transplantation (dpt), indicating that the transplanted cells migrated to the genital ridge and had colonized the developing gonad. However, further PCR and in situ hybridization analyses of YTK gonads at 165 dpt and PCR analysis of semen collected from sexually mature transplanted YTK males at 1.5 years post transplantation, were not able to detect SBT germ cell-derived DNA or RNA, suggesting that the donor cells were not maintained in the hosts' gonads. YTK larvae were shown to support migration and colonization of transplanted SBT spermatogonial cells, despite the phylogenetic distance between the two species. Other species from the Scombridae family (which are phylogenetically closer to SBT) were considered as potential surrogate hosts for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to increase the chances of successful development of the transplanted cells. A method for capture and transport of live pelagic Scombrid fish using "tuna tubes" was developed and optimized. Eight medium-sized mackerel tuna (\emph{{{Euthynnus affinis}}}, also known as eastern little tuna or kawakawa) and leaping bonito (\emph{{{Cybiosarda elegans}}}) were captured and transported alive to the holding tank at the Bribie Island Research Centre (BIRC), 3 of them acclimatized to the tank conditions. Twenty-eight additional small-sized blue mackerels (\emph{{{Scomber australasicus}}}) were captured and transported alive to BIRC, using a 300 L rectangular transport tank, and were treated to induce spawning. None of the captured fish spawned in captivity, but the methods and equipment that were developed and optimized, proved useful for small-scale capture and transport of live Scombrids, as a preliminary step for the establishment of a potential surrogate host broodstock for the SBT. Key genes involved in the reproductive molecular pathway and specifically, germ cell development in the gonads, were described using transcriptome analysis of male and female SBT gonad cells, acquired by next-generation RNA-sequencing. Expression profiles of transcripts from ovary and testis cells were compared, as well as Percoll-enriched cell preparations (as used in GCT) to crude testis cells. ASG-specific genes were identified for the first time in SBT, and were used to develop molecular markers to allow specific identification and localization of different germ cell populations in SBT gonads. These SBT germ cell-specific molecular probes were used to distinguish between transplanted SBT germ cells and the YTK host endogenous cells in a GCT experiment. The methods, experience, tools and knowledge acquired in this study present for the first time the exciting possibility of GCT to produce inter-species surrogates for the SBT. The tools established in this research will enable the Australian aquaculture industry to continue and pursue surrogate technology for the SBT, as well as to other hard-to-breed, large and late-maturing high-valued species.},

  abstract = {Until 2016, the Australian shrimp industry was considered free of White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a destructive pathogen responsible for the huge economic losses in the shrimp culture industry in most shrimp producing countries worldwide. In December 2016, there was an outbreak of WSSV in commercial \emph{{{Penaeus monodon shrimp farms located on the Logan River in Queensland, northeast Australia which resulted in the loss of all shrimp production on the Logan river either directly from the virus itself or indirectly through destruction of the shrimp production as part of quarantine measures. The first objective of this study was to consider the possible origins of the outbreak, whether the WSSV outbreak arose of an exotic introduction or a local endemic strain. The Australian WSSV DNA sequences, from nine farmed samples, amplified using the 146F2R2 primers spanning relatively conserved regions, were identical to each other and had very close identity to overseas WSSV strains which did not refute the working hypothesis that the outbreak was caused by an invasive species from overseas rather than from entry into aquaculture of a long term Australian endemic strain. The second objective was to consider the possible source of the outbreak (i.e. country or region). To do this, highly variable genomic WSSV regions were identified and novel primers designed for this study to amplify variable genomic regions so it would be possible to conduct DNA sequence comparisons, theoretically, from a hundreds of samples in a relatively short period of time and low cost, something not readily possible with full genomic sequencing. In practice we generated DNA sequences using up to five of these novel primers (and the published ORF 125 variable primers) from three Australian farmed shrimp samples, from two farmed Vietnamese samples (from the north and south of the country), one retail product from Vietnam and one retail product from China sold in Australia and compared these sequences to 10 published overseas WSSV genomes. Available data indicated the Australian sequences were most similar to published sequences from China, and less closely related to sequences from other regions, for example sequences we derived from Vietnamese farmed samples. The third objective was to assess possible physical routes of infection into Australia by testing for the presence of WSSV DNA in aquaculture feed samples used at the time of the outbreak and in imported shrimp retail items. No PCR positives were detected from two samples of shrimp feeds used at the time of the outbreak. Nearly every Australian retail item of imported shrimp product (12 out of 13) tested positive for WSSV and DNA sequences could be obtained from the amplified PCR products indicating that at some point in their history, nearly all the imported samples were in contact with WSSV. In conclusion, our data, considered together, are consistent with the following hypotheses: an exotic shrimp virus, WSSV, which is of considerable economic importance, has breached Australia's biosecurity; the Australian WSSV strain is mostly closely related to one reported from Asia; a plausible physical route of entry may have been through the importation of WSSV infected shrimp for retail sale.}}}},

  abstract = {This study examined the effectiveness of an open channel, low pressure (LP), ultraviolet (UV) reactor for water treatment in a low head (LH) recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). Currently available UV reactors use high pressure pumps and submerged bulbs. The reactor in this study makes use of the head gained by the water recirculation of the LH-RAS without the need for additional pumps, while the bulbs are located above water surface to ease maintenance and lower costs. The UV reactor's output was characterized and evaluated by measuring the fluence rate distribution at various X, Y locations and average UV fluence rate delivered to the water surface using spherical chemical actinometry. The average UV fluence rate measured in dry conditions at the surface of the test water was 2.3 mW cm−2. Measurements of the exponential decay of irradiance in the water with the increase in water depth corresponded well with transmittance results, and were used to estimate the reactor's UV dose at different water flow rates. Using collimated beam apparatus (CBA), the inactivation of heterotrophic microorganisms in the RAS as a function of UV fluence showed that survival of bacteria dropped significantly as the UV dose increased and then stabilized at higher UV doses. Log survival at the UV reactor installed in the RAS was used to back calculate the average UV dose, which resulted to be of ∼2 mJ cm−2 based of the CBA data, and ∼4 mJ cm−2 based on dose equations at water flow rates of 100 m3 h−1. Only a certain amount of sensitive bacteria can be inactivated by fluence rates delivered at UV doses of 2–4 mJ cm−2, thus to increase the delivered UV dose, it is suggested to increase the power of the UV bulbs, and to use this system in water with low transmittance and gravitational flow as in LH-RAS, for the benefit of controlling pathogenic bacteria proliferation.},

These new data support the hypothesis of population subdivision between the Northeast Pacific, Northwest Pacific and South Pacific, and genetic divergence indicates restriction to the gene flow between hemispheres. However, our estimates of maximum mtDNA and nuclear DNA divergences of 2.43\% and 0.67\%, respectively, were within the ranges more commonly observed for populations within species than species within genera.

This study was conducted to better understand the risk posed by the Australian A. rabiei population to current resistance sources and to provide informed decision support for chemical control strategies. Recent changes in the pathogenicity of the population were proposed based on disease severity and histopathological observations on a host set. Controlled environment disease screening of 201 isolates on the host set revealed distinct pathogenicity groups, with 41\% of all isolates assessed as highly aggressive and a significant increase in the proportion of isolates able to cause severe damage on resistant and moderately resistant cultivars since 2013. In particular, the frequency of highly aggressive isolates on the widely adopted PBA HatTrick cultivar rose from 18\% in 2013 to 68\% in 2017. In addition, isolates collected since 2016 caused severe disease on Genesis 090, another widely adopted moderately resistant cultivar and on ICC3996, a commonly used resistance source. Of immediate concern was the 10\% of highly aggressive isolates able to severely damage the recently released resistant cultivar PBA Seamer (2016). Histopathology studies revealed that the most aggressive isolates were able to germinate, develop appressoria and invade directly through the epidermis faster than lower aggressive isolates on all hosts assessed, including ICC3996. The fungal invasion triggered a common reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypersensitive response (HR) on all assessed resistant genotypes with initial biochemical and subsequent structural defence responses initiated within 24 hours of inoculation by the most highly aggressive isolates. These responses were much faster on the less resistant and fastest on the susceptible check host, indicating that speed of recognition was correlated with resistance rating. This will inform fungicide application timing so that infected crops are sprayed with prophylactic chemistries prior to invasion and with systemic chemistries after the pathogen has invaded.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Inconsistency in flavour is one of the major challenges to the Australian papaya industry. However, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles that provide preferable taste and aroma, together with consumer acceptability, have not been set. In this study, three red-flesh papayas (i.e., ‘RB1’, ‘RB4’, and ‘Skybury’) and two yellow-flesh papayas (i.e., ‘1B’ and ‘H13’) were presented to a trained sensory panel and a consumer panel to assess sensory profiles and liking. The papaya samples were also examined for sugar components, total soluble solids, and 14 selected volatile compounds. Additionally, the expression patterns of 10 genes related to sweetness and volatile metabolism were assessed. In general, red papaya varieties had higher sugar content and tasted sweeter than yellow varieties, while yellow varieties had higher concentrations of citrus floral aroma volatiles and higher aroma intensity. Higher concentrations of glucose, linalool oxide, and terpinolene were significantly associated with decreased consumer liking. Significant differences were observed in the expression profiles of all the genes assessed among the selected papaya varieties. Of these, cpGPT2 and cpBGLU31 were positively correlated to glucose production and were expressed significantly higher in ‘1B’ than in ‘RB1’ or ‘Skybury’. These findings will assist in the strategic selective breeding for papaya to better match consumer and, hence, market demand.},

  abstract = {Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important cool season food legume, however, its production is severely constrained by the foliar disease Ascochyta blight caused by the fungus Ascochyta rabiei (syn. Phoma rabiei). Several disease management options have been developed to control the pathogen, including breeding for host plant resistance. However, the pathogen population is evolving to produce more aggressive isolates. For host resistance to be effective, the plant must quickly recognize the pathogen and instigate initial defense mechanisms, optimally at the point of contact. Given that the most resistant host genotypes display rapid pathogen recognition and response, the approach taken was to assess the type, speed and pattern of recognition via Resistance Gene Analogue (RGA) transcription among resistant and susceptible cultivated chickpea varieties. RGAs are key factors in the recognition of plant pathogens and the signaling of inducible defenses. In this study, a suite of RGA loci were chosen for further investigation from both published literature and from newly mined homologous sequences within the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Following their validation in the chickpea genome, 10 target RGAs were selected for differential expression analysis in response to A. rabiei infection. This was performed in a set of four chickpea varieties including two resistant cultivars (ICC3996 and PBA Seamer), one moderately resistant cultivar (PBA HatTrick) and one susceptible cultivar (Kyabra). Gene expression at each RGA locus was assessed via qPCR at 2, 6, and 24 hours after A. rabiei inoculation with a previously characterized highly aggressive isolate. As a result, all loci were differentially transcribed in response to pathogen infection in at least one genotype and at least one time point after inoculation. Among these, the differential expression of four RGAs was significant and consistently increased in the most resistant genotype ICC3996 immediately following inoculation, when spore germination began and ahead of penetration into the plant’s epidermal tissues. Further in silico analyses indicated that the differentially transcribed RGAs function through ADP-binding within the pathogen recognition pathway. These represent clear targets for future functional validation and potential for selective resistance breeding for introgression into elite cultivars.},

  abstract = {A major challenge to the papaya industry is inconsistency in fruit quality and, in particular, flavour, which is a complex trait that comprises taste perception in the mouth (sweetness, acidity, or bitterness) and aroma produced by several volatile compounds. Current commercial varieties vary greatly in their taste, likely due to historical prioritised selection for fruit appearance as well as large environmental effects. Therefore, it is important to better understand the genetic and biochemical mechanisms and biosynthesis pathways underpinning preferable flavour in order to select and breed for better tasting new commercial papaya varieties. As an initial step, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles that provide papaya’s taste and aroma, together with ‘mouth feel’, are required. This review presents an overview of the approaches to characterise the flavour profiles of papaya through sugar component determination, volatile compound detection, sensory panel testing, as well as genomics-based studies to identify the papaya flavour.},
