abstract: Plant pathogens are a major reason for reduced crop productivity and may
  lead to shortage of food for both human and animal consumption. Although chemical
  control remains the main method to reduce foliar fungal disease incidence, frequent
  use can lead to loss of susceptibility in the fungal population. Also, over-spraying
  can cause environmental contamination and poses a heavy financial burden on growers.
  To prevent or control disease epidemics, it is important for growers to be able
  to detect the causal pathogen accurately, sensitively, and rapidly in order to choose
  and enact best practice disease management strategies. Several culture-dependent,
  biochemical, and molecular methods have been developed for plant pathogen detection.
  However, these suffer from lack of accuracy, specificity, reliability, and rapidity,
  and they are generally not suitable for in-situ analysis. Accordingly, there is
  strong interest in developing biosensing systems for early and accurate pathogen
  detection. There is also great scope to translate innovative nanoparticle-based
  biosensor approaches developed initially for human disease diagnostics for early
  detection of plant disease-causing pathogens. In this review, we compare conventional
  methods used in plant disease diagnostics with new biosensor technologies that may
  be applied for plant pathogen detection and management. In addition, we discuss
  challenges facing biosensors and new capability the technology provides to informing
  disease management strategies.
