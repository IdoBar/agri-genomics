abstract: Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are calcifying red macroalgae that play important
  ecological roles including stabilisation of reef frameworks and provision of settlement
  cues for a range of marine invertebrates. Previous research into the responses of
  CCA to ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA) have found magnitude of effect
  to be species-specific. Response to OW and OA could be linked to divergent underlying
  molecular processes across species.
