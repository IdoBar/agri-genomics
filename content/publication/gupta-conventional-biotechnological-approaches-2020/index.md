abstract: Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is an important cool-season food crop grown
  in various parts of the world as it offers ecological, environmental value and nutritional
  security. To sustain food production for future generations, lentil cultivars should
  possess tolerance/resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Existing cultivars
  have a narrow genetic base and are primarily bred for traits which are yield centric.
  Therefore, to improve these cultivars, useful untapped genes of interest need to
  be incorporated from wild and distant cultivated backgrounds. This chapter highlights
  significant work done through lentil pre-breeding for important traits (agronomical,
  seed quality, tolerance to heat, drought, cold and frost and resistance to various
  fungal disease). These traits have either been incorporated or still need to be
  introduced into existing or new lentil cultivars.
