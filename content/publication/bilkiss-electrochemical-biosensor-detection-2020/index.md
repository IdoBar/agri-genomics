abstract: A greater achievement in the Integrated Disease Management (IDM) to prevent
  the loss would result from early diagnosis and quantitation of the causal pathogen
  species for accurate and timely disease control. This could significantly reduce
  costs to the growers and reduce any flow on impacts to the environment from excessive
  chemical spraying. Necrotrophic fungal disease botrytis grey mould, caused by Botrytis
  cinerea and Botrytis fabae, significantly reduce temperate legume yield and grain
  quality during favourable environmental condition in Australia and worldwide. Several
  immunogenic and molecular probe-type protocols have been developed for their diagnosis,
  but these have varying levels of speciesspecificity, sensitivity, and consequent
  usefulness within the paddock. To substantially improve speed, accuracy, and sensitivity,
  advanced nanoparticle-based biosensor approaches have been developed. For this,
  two sets of primers were designed for both Botrytis cinerea and Botrytis fabae which
  have shown the species specificity with initial sensitivity of two genomic copies/µl
  in pure fungal backgrounds using multiplexed quantitative PCR. During further validation,
  quantitative PCR detected 100 spores on artificially infected legume leaves. Simultaneously
  an electro-catalytic assay was developed for both target fungal DNA using functionalised
  magnetic nanoparticles. This was extremely sensitive, able to detect a single spore
  within a raw total plant nucleic acid extract background. We believe that the translation
  of this technology to the field will enable quantitative assessment of pathogen
  load for future accurate decision support of informed botrytis grey mould management.
