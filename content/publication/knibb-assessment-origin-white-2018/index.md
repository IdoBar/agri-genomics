abstract: "Until 2016, the Australian shrimp industry was considered free of White\
  \ Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a destructive pathogen responsible for the huge economic\
  \ losses in the shrimp culture industry in most shrimp producing countries worldwide.\
  \ In December 2016, there was an outbreak of WSSV in commercial Penaeus monodon\
  \ shrimp farms located on the Logan River in Queensland, northeast Australia which\
  \ resulted in the loss of all shrimp production on the Logan river either directly\
  \ from the virus itself or indirectly through destruction of the shrimp production\
  \ as part of quarantine measures. The first objective of this study was to consider\
  \ the possible origins of the outbreak, whether the WSSV outbreak arose of an exotic\
  \ introduction or a local endemic strain. The Australian WSSV DNA sequences, from\
  \ nine farmed samples, amplified using the 146F2R2 primers spanning relatively conserved\
  \ regions, were identical to each other and had very close identity to overseas\
  \ WSSV strains which did not refute the working hypothesis that the outbreak was\
  \ caused by an invasive species from overseas rather than from entry into aquaculture\
  \ of a long term Australian endemic strain. The second objective was to consider\
  \ the possible source of the outbreak (i.e. country or region). To do this, highly\
  \ variable genomic WSSV regions were identified and novel primers designed for this\
  \ study to amplify variable genomic regions so it would be possible to conduct DNA\
  \ sequence comparisons, theoretically, from a hundreds of samples in a relatively\
  \ short period of time and low cost, something not readily possible with full genomic\
  \ sequencing. In practice we generated DNA sequences using up to five of these novel\
  \ primers (and the published ORF 125 variable primers) from three Australian farmed\
  \ shrimp samples, from two farmed Vietnamese samples (from the north and south of\
  \ the country), one retail product from Vietnam and one retail product from China\
  \ sold in Australia and compared these sequences to 10 published overseas WSSV genomes.\
  \ Available data indicated the Australian sequences were most similar to published\
  \ sequences from China, and less closely related to sequences from other regions,\
  \ for example sequences we derived from Vietnamese farmed samples. The third objective\
  \ was to assess possible physical routes of infection into Australia by testing\
  \ for the presence of WSSV DNA in aquaculture feed samples used at the time of the\
  \ outbreak and in imported shrimp retail items. No PCR positives were detected from\
  \ two samples of shrimp feeds used at the time of the outbreak. Nearly every Australian\
  \ retail item of imported shrimp product (12 out of 13) tested positive for WSSV\
  \ and DNA sequences could be obtained from the amplified PCR products indicating\
  \ that at some point in their history, nearly all the imported samples were in contact\
  \ with WSSV. In conclusion, our data, considered together, are consistent with the\
  \ following hypotheses: an exotic shrimp virus, WSSV, which is of considerable economic\
  \ importance, has breached Australia's biosecurity; the Australian WSSV strain is\
  \ mostly closely related to one reported from Asia; a plausible physical route of\
  \ entry may have been through the importation of WSSV infected shrimp for retail\
  \ sale."
