abstract: Germ cell transplantation is an innovative technology for the production
  of interspecies surrogates, capable of facilitating easier and more economical management
  of large-bodied broodstock, such as the bluefin tuna. The present study explored
  the suitability of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) as a surrogate host
  for transplanted southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) spermatogonial cells
  to produce tuna donor-derived gametes upon sexual maturity. Germ cell populations
  in testes of donor T. maccoyii males were described using basic histology and
  the molecular markers vasa and dead-end genes. The peripheral area of the testis
  was found to contain the highest proportions of dead-end-expressing transplantable
  Type A spermatogonia. T. maccoyii Type A spermatogonia-enriched preparations
  were transplanted into the coelomic cavity of 6–10-day-old post-hatch S. lalandi
  larvae. Fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis detected
  the presence of tuna cells in the gonads of the transplanted kingfish fingerlings
  at 18, 28, 39 and 75 days after transplantation, indicating that the transplanted
  cells migrated to the genital ridge and had colonised the developing gonad. T.
  maccoyii germ cell-derived DNA or RNA was not detected at later stages, suggesting
  that the donor cells were not maintained in the hosts’ gonads.
