abstract: The identification and characterisation of quantitative trait loci (QTL)
  is an important step towards identifying functional sequences underpinning important
  crop traits and for developing accurate markers for selective breeding strategies.
  In this study, a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach detected QTL conditioning
  desirable fruit quality traits in papaya.
