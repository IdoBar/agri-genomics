 abstract = {The identification and characterisation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) is an important step towards identifying functional sequences underpinning important crop traits and for developing accurate markers for selective breeding strategies. In this study, a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach detected QTL conditioning desirable fruit quality traits in papaya.},
