abstract: The orange-spotted grouper (OG), Epinephelus coioides, is an ecologically
  and economically important species with strong market demand. However, larval rearing
  for this species is especially difficult, with mass mortality occurring at multiple
  stages including the period coinciding with metamorphic development. The aim of
  the present study was to characterise the molecular ontogenesis of genes that influence
  appetite, feeding, and digestion in OG larvae head and body tissue at 12, 18, and
  50,days post hatch (dph), which coincides with the beginning and end of metamorphic
  development. The sequences of many transcripts involved in the regulation of appetite,
  feeding and digestive processes were detected from 12,dph in OG larvae, including
  those that were differentially expressed in body tissue in fish at different stages
  of development such as cholecystokinin, peptide Y, and meprin A. Of the transcripts
  encoding digestive enzymes, only the expression level of bile salt-activated lipase
  decreased as development progressed. In contrast, a dramatic increase in expression
  for other body-expressed transcripts encoding digestive enzymes and a proton pump
  subunit was observed at 50,dph, which is indicative of an increase in digestive
  capacity. In addition, we have provided evidence suggesting that various trypsinogen
  isoforms are present, and have differing expression patterns throughout larval development
  in whole body tissue. We also report on the presence of a prey-specific transcript
  encoding Î±-amylase that was present in the body-transcriptome. Taken together, these
  results give insight into the processes underpinning attainment of digestive capacity,
  and form the basis of a new transcriptomic database that will aid further study
  into the digestive development and dietary requirements of orange-spotted grouper
  larvae.
