abstract: Australian lentil production is affected by several major biotic constraints
  including Ascochyta blight (AB), caused by Ascochyta lentis, a devastating fungal
  disease. Cultivation of AB resistant cultivars, alongside agronomic management including
  fungicide application, is the current most economically viable control strategy.
  However, the breakdown of AB resistance in cultivars, such as Northfield and Nipper,
  suggests the need for introgression of new and diverse resistance genes. Successful
  introgression entails an understanding of the genetic basis of resistance. In this
  context, a biparental mapping population derived from a cross between a recently
  identified AB resistant accession ILWL 180 (Lens orientalis) and a susceptible cultivar
  ILL 6002 was produced. A genetic linkage map was constructed from single-nucleotide
  polymorphism markers generated using a genotyping-by-sequencing transcript approach.
  Genetic dissection of the mapping population revealed a major quantitative trait
  loci (QTL) region nested with three QTLs on linkage group 5 and explained 9.5â€“11.5
  percent (%) of phenotypic variance for AB resistance. Another QTL was identified
  on LG2 with phenotypic variance of 9.6%. The identified QTL regions harbored putative
  candidate genes potentially associated with defense responses to A. lentis infection.
  The QTL analysis and the candidate gene information are expected to contribute to
  the development of diagnostic markers and enable marker-assisted resistance selection
  in lentil breeding programmes.
