abstract: Controlling and managing the breeding of bluefin tuna (Thunnus spp.) in
  captivity is an imperative step towards obtaining a sustainable supply of these
  fish in aquaculture production systems. Germ cell transplantation (GCT) is an innovative
  technology for the production of inter-species surrogates, by transplanting undifferentiated
  germ cells derived from a donor species into larvae of a host species. The transplanted
  surrogates will then grow and mature to produce donor-derived seed, thus providing
  a simpler alternative to maintaining large-bodied broodstock such as the bluefin
  tuna. Implementation of GCT for new species requires the development of molecular
  tools to follow the fate of the transplanted germ cells. These tools are based on
  key reproductive and germ cell-specific genes. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides
  a rapid, cost-effective method for high throughput gene identification in non-model
  species. This study utilized RNA-Seq to identify key genes expressed in the gonads
  of Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii, SBT) and their specific expression
  patterns in male and female gonad cells.
