abstract: Inconsistency in flavour is one of the major challenges to the Australian
  papaya industry. However, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles
  that provide preferable taste and aroma, together with consumer acceptability, have
  not been set. In this study, three red-flesh papayas (i.e., ‘RB1’, ‘RB4’, and ‘Skybury’)
  and two yellow-flesh papayas (i.e., ‘1B’ and ‘H13’) were presented to a trained
  sensory panel and a consumer panel to assess sensory profiles and liking. The papaya
  samples were also examined for sugar components, total soluble solids, and 14 selected
  volatile compounds. Additionally, the expression patterns of 10 genes related to
  sweetness and volatile metabolism were assessed. In general, red papaya varieties
  had higher sugar content and tasted sweeter than yellow varieties, while yellow
  varieties had higher concentrations of citrus floral aroma volatiles and higher
  aroma intensity. Higher concentrations of glucose, linalool oxide, and terpinolene
  were significantly associated with decreased consumer liking. Significant differences
  were observed in the expression profiles of all the genes assessed among the selected
  papaya varieties. Of these, cpGPT2 and cpBGLU31 were positively correlated to glucose
  production and were expressed significantly higher in ‘1B’ than in ‘RB1’ or ‘Skybury’.
  These findings will assist in the strategic selective breeding for papaya to better
  match consumer and, hence, market demand.
