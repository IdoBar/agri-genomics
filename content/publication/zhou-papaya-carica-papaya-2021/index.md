abstract: A major challenge to the papaya industry is inconsistency in fruit quality
  and, in particular, flavour, which is a complex trait that comprises taste perception
  in the mouth (sweetness, acidity, or bitterness) and aroma produced by several volatile
  compounds. Current commercial varieties vary greatly in their taste, likely due
  to historical prioritised selection for fruit appearance as well as large environmental
  effects. Therefore, it is important to better understand the genetic and biochemical
  mechanisms and biosynthesis pathways underpinning preferable flavour in order to
  select and breed for better tasting new commercial papaya varieties. As an initial
  step, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles that provide papaya’s
  taste and aroma, together with ‘mouth feel’, are required. This review presents
  an overview of the approaches to characterise the flavour profiles of papaya through
  sugar component determination, volatile compound detection, sensory panel testing,
  as well as genomics-based studies to identify the papaya flavour.
