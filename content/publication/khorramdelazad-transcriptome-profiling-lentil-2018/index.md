abstract: Ascochyta blight, caused by the fungus Ascochyta lentis, is one of the
  most destructive lentil diseases worldwide, resulting in over $16 million AUD annual
  loss in Australia alone. The use of resistant cultivars is currently considered
  the most effective and environmentally sustainable strategy to control this disease.
  However, little is known about the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying lentil
  resistance against A. lentis.
